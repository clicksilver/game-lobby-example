# Game Lobby Example

This project is a simplified reference implementation of how to use [boardgame.io](boardgame.io)
lobby server API, in order to create multiplayer games.

I didn't write any of this code. I just forked averycrespi's [Thinktank](https://github.com/averycrespi/thinktank)
which is **beautifully** written and the inspiration for this reference. I knew
zero typescript and react coming into this project, and it was a total blast to
read through.

This can be the skeleton implementation of a multiplayer game that you want to
develop using [boardgame.io](boardgame.io).
